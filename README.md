- A3 a) Modelling Household Consumption Expenditure: A Multiple Linear Regression and Machine Learning Approach Using NSSO Data

- Introduction

Examining the determinants of household consumption expenditure is integral to effective policy
making, welfare distribution, and socio-economic research in developing countries. The National
Sample Survey Office (NSSO) provides extensive, large-scale micro-level data that captures
consumption behaviours across the vast and diverse population of India. This study will use NSSO 68th
Round data to examine the primary determinants of Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE), a
common measure of household welfare in India.

Due to the scale and variety of data, it is reasonable to expect violations of classical modelling
assumptions to arise. Therefore, this report considers a multi-layered statistical procedure starting with
multiple linear regression (MLR), followed by comprehensive diagnostic testing and model
improvements to correct multiple issues (multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, non-normality of
residuals, etc). Random Forest regression is also utilised to compare model performance and support a
non-parametric understanding of variable importance. 

- A3 b) Regression Analysis of IPL Salaries and Player Performance (2022â€“2024)

- Introduction

In the IPL, player salaries are contingent on current form, but also operate according to market
dynamics, fan interaction, and expected potential. Yet, pinning down how much on-field performance
actually matters in determining a player's salary is still a critical question to analyse. In this paper, we
look at whether IPL franchises are actually rewarding their players according to their recent form with
the bat in terms of total runs scored in the most recent three seasons.
